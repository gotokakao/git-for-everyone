Commissioner Gordon and his daughter, Barbara are on vacation aboard a cruise ship in the Far East. 
Commissioner is on the trip so he can scout "fireman facilities in the Orient", and Barbara is coming so she can reunite with her old college friend, Reiko Hammamoto. Everything is going well until an enormous tidal wave falls over the ship and capsizes it. The giant wave turns out to be the work of Klaus Finster, a German meteorologist who moved to Japan. In his secret lair (hidden under Mount Fuji), Klaus claims that he has control of the entire weather, and will destroy Japan unless he is given 20 million dollars in gold. Gordon decides that there is only one way to stop Klaus from destroying Japan: calling Batman and Robin.
